RIP SEGFAULT.NET, THANK YOU AND GOOD BYE

22 years of hosting hackers has come to an end.

Segfault.net started hosting hackers in 1997. The main goal has always
been to provide infrastructure for hackers and to support them.

Hacking was still in its infancy. Servers were hard to get by. Documents
had to be forged, rack space had to be rented and the server had to be
custom built.

Thank you to all the people who participated and all the project we hosted.
It was home to team-teso, thc, hert, hackinthebox, phrack.org, ircsnet and
many others.

It was the gateway to the internal Teso Lab that hosted more than 10 further
computer systems of different architecture and OS versions. Countless
exploits were developed and tested here. Gamma provided blueboxed Internet
connections via Brazil, Columbia and other C5 countries to unleash those
exploits.

IRCSNET became home to so many awesome discussions. I believe it was the
first SSL-only IRC network spanning over 4 servers at its peak and hosting
hundreds of conversations.

We provided encrypted and secure shells to so many talented people that it
is eye watering.

There were some hard times as well. Nokia suing us, the BKA (German FBI)
knocking on the door, our IP address being routed via Fort Meade or the
hosting company saying they will host us for free 'because they were big
fans of us' (yeah, right - we moved segfault.net to 1and1 immediately...
damn fedz).

Hosting at 1and1 was probably best. The guy responsible for hacking
incidents and government relationship....he was on our payroll.

Segfault.net prevailed and nobody ever got arrested or caught.

Times have changed now. Shells and servers are easily available.
DigitalOcean, AWS or google clouds are cheap and hassle free. Those
are much harder to trust or to make secure (uploading a virtual machine
is probably the best). Governments are more aware now. Yet, they are as
ruthless and ignorant as they have always been. Beware of governments as
they do not know what they are doing.

Segfault.net was the birth place to so many great ideas, tools, products
and companies. Thank you all.

Good bye and Good luck and Keep Hacking,
